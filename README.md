# Sofrito
A savoury front-end base with advanced typographic, layout, performance and build ingredients.

Sofrito uses a Gulp-based build system.

## Quick Start

In bash/terminal/command line, cd into your project directory.
- Run npm install to install required files and dependencies.
- When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
-- `gulp` manually compiles files.
-- `gulp watch` automatically compiles files when you save changes to source files and optionally uses BrowserSync to refresh your web browser.
