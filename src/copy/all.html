        This is a paragraph. It's just something I threw together. In the beginning was the word. And the word wrapped. I'll be looking soon for opportunities to style this text. In the meantime it will do merely to occupy space.

        This is an improperly marked paragraph sequence, with <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> used as a paragraph separator rather than as a container. It's dismaying how common this is. It's just something I threw together. In the beginning was the word. And the word wrapped. I'll be looking soon for opportunities to style this text. In the meantime it will do merely to occupy space.
