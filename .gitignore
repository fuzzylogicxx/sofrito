# Don’t track built/compiled artefacts in version control.
# We already track the /src files; build /dist as a build step in a CI/CD environment prior to deployment to your remote server.
# Note: for the purposes of Sofrito’s demo pages we need the built artefacts.
# But you don’t so can use this:
dist/*
